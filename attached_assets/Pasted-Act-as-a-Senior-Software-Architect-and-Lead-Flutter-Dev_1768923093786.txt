Act as a Senior Software Architect and Lead Flutter Developer.
I am building an MVP for a SaaS Training Management Platform (LMS) called "TadreebLink".
The target audience is: NGOs, Training Centers, and Freelance Trainers.
The goal is to launch a functional MVP in 10 days using **Flutter (Web & Mobile)** and **Firebase**.

### 1. Project Context & Requirements:
* **Business Model:** Multi-tenant SaaS (Each Organization/Trainer has their own isolated data/students).
* **User Roles:**
    1.  **Super Admin:** (Me, managing the platform).
    2.  **Org Admin:** (The client - NGO Manager/Training Center Owner). Creates courses, adds students, views analytics.
    3.  **Instructor:** (Freelancer or Employee). Grades assignments, manages course content.
    4.  **Student:** (The trainee). Views courses, watches videos, submits assignments.

### 2. Tech Stack:
* **Frontend:** Flutter (Targeting Web for MVP primarily).
* **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore NoSQL Database, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage).
* **State Management:** Riverpod (or Provider).
* **Routing:** GoRouter.

### 3. Core MVP Features (Scope):
1.  **Multi-role Authentication:** Users sign in and are routed to their specific dashboard based on role (Admin Dashboard vs. Student View).
2.  **Course Management:** Create/Edit Courses -> Modules -> Lessons (Video URL, PDF).
3.  **Student Management:** Enroll students in courses manually or via link.
4.  **Assignments:** Text-based or file upload assignments + Grading system.
5.  **Analytics (Crucial):** Dashboard showing: Attendance rate, Assignment completion rate, Average scores.

### 4. YOUR TASK:
Please provide a complete technical roadmap and code foundation for this MVP. Specifically, generate the following:

**Step 1: The Database Schema (Firestore)**
* Design a scalable NoSQL schema.
* Define Collections: `organizations`, `users`, `courses`, `enrollments`, `assignments`, `submissions`.
* Show the JSON structure for each document, ensuring we handle "Multi-tenancy" (e.g., every document must have `orgId`).

**Step 2: Project Structure & Dependencies**
* Propose a "Clean Architecture" folder structure for Flutter (`lib/core`, `lib/features`, `lib/models`, etc.).
* List the essential `pubspec.yaml` packages needed for this specific stack.

**Step 3: Core Data Models (Dart Code)**
* Write the Dart classes (using `freezed` or standard) for: `AppUser`, `Course`, `Lesson`, `Assignment`.
* Include `toMap()` and `fromMap()` methods for Firestore integration.

**Step 4: The "Role-Based Redirect" Logic**
* Write the logic for a `AuthWrapper` widget that checks the user's role from Firestore after login and redirects them to the correct screen (AdminHome vs. StudentHome).

**Step 5: The "Analytics" Service Logic**
* Write a pseudo-code or service function to calculate "Course Completion Rate" for a specific Organization.

Please be precise, use best practices for scalability, and ensure the code is ready to copy-paste.
